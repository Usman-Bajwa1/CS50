One way to measure the complexity of a program is to count its number of lines of code (LOC), excluding blank lines and comments. 
For instance, a program like:
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"hello, {name}")

has just two lines of code, not four, since its first line is a comment, and its second line is blank (i.e., just whitespace). 
That’s not that many, so odds are the program isn’t that complex. Of course, just because a program (or even function) has more 
lines of code than another doesn’t necessarily mean it’s more complex. For instance, a function like
def is_even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

isn’t really twice as complex as a function like

def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

even though the former has (more than) twice as many lines of code. In fact, the former might arguably be simpler if it’s easier 
to read! So lines of code should be taken with a grain of salt. Even so, in a file called lines.py, implement a program that 
expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a Python file, and outputs the number of lines of code in that
file, excluding comments and blank lines. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified 
file’s name does not end in .py, or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.
Assume that any line that starts with #, optionally preceded by whitespace, is a comment. (A docstring should not be considered a 
comment.) Assume that any line that only contains whitespace is blank.

Perhaps the most popular place for pizza in Harvard Square is Pinocchio’s Pizza & Subs, aka Noch’s, known for its Sicilian pizza, 
which is “a deep-dish or thick-crust pizza.” Students tend to buy pizza by the slice, but Pinocchio’s also has whole pizzas on its 
menu too, per this CSV file of Sicilian pizzas, sicilian.csv, below:

Sicilian Pizza,Small,Large
Cheese,$25.50,$39.95
1 item,$27.50,$41.95
2 items,$29.50,$43.95
3 items,$31.50,$45.95
Special,$33.50,$47.95

See regular.csv for a CSV file of regular pizzas as well.
Of course, a CSV file isn’t the most customer-friendly format to look at. Prettier might be a table, formatted as ASCII art, like this one:
+------------------+---------+---------+
| Sicilian Pizza   | Small   | Large   |
+==================+=========+=========+
| Cheese           | $25.50  | $39.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 1 item           | $27.50  | $41.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 2 items          | $29.50  | $43.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| 3 items          | $31.50  | $45.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+
| Special          | $33.50  | $47.95  |
+------------------+---------+---------+


In a file called pizza.py, implement a program that expects exactly one command-line argument, the name (or path) of a CSV file in Pinocchio’s 
format, and outputs a table formatted as ASCII art using tabulate, a package on PyPI at pypi.org/project/tabulate. Format the table using the 
library’s grid format. If the user does not specify exactly one command-line argument, or if the specified file’s name does not end in .csv, 
or if the specified file does not exist, the program should instead exit via sys.exit.

Data, too, often needs to be “cleaned,” as by reformatting it, so that values are in a consistent, if not more convenient, 
format. Consider, for instance, this CSV file of students, before.csv, below:
name,house
"Abbott, Hannah",Hufflepuff
"Bell, Katie",Gryffindor
"Bones, Susan",Hufflepuff
"Boot, Terry",Ravenclaw
"Brown, Lavender",Gryffindor
"Bulstrode, Millicent",Slytherin
"Chang, Cho",Ravenclaw
"Clearwater, Penelope",Ravenclaw
"Crabbe, Vincent",Slytherin
"Creevey, Colin",Gryffindor
"Creevey, Dennis",Gryffindor
"Diggory, Cedric",Hufflepuff
"Edgecombe, Marietta",Ravenclaw
"Finch-Fletchley, Justin",Hufflepuff
"Finnigan, Seamus",Gryffindor
"Goldstein, Anthony",Ravenclaw
"Goyle, Gregory",Slytherin
"Granger, Hermione",Gryffindor
"Johnson, Angelina",Gryffindor
"Jordan, Lee",Gryffindor
"Longbottom, Neville",Gryffindor
"Lovegood, Luna",Ravenclaw
"Lupin, Remus",Gryffindor
"Malfoy, Draco",Slytherin
"Malfoy, Scorpius",Slytherin
"Macmillan, Ernie",Hufflepuff
"McGonagall, Minerva",Gryffindor
"Midgen, Eloise",Gryffindor
"McLaggen, Cormac",Gryffindor
"Montague, Graham",Slytherin
"Nott, Theodore",Slytherin
"Parkinson, Pansy",Slytherin
"Patil, Padma",Gryffindor
"Patil, Parvati",Gryffindor
"Potter, Harry",Gryffindor
"Riddle, Tom",Slytherin
"Robins, Demelza",Gryffindor
"Scamander, Newt",Hufflepuff
"Slughorn, Horace",Slytherin
"Smith, Zacharias",Hufflepuff
"Snape, Severus",Slytherin
"Spinnet, Alicia",Gryffindor
"Sprout, Pomona",Hufflepuff
"Thomas, Dean",Gryffindor
"Vane, Romilda",Gryffindor
"Warren, Myrtle",Ravenclaw
"Weasley, Fred",Gryffindor
"Weasley, George",Gryffindor
"Weasley, Ginny",Gryffindor
"Weasley, Percy",Gryffindor
"Weasley, Ron",Gryffindor
"Wood, Oliver",Gryffindor
"Zabini, Blaise",Slytherin

Even though each “row” in the file has three values (last name, first name, and house), the first two are combined into one “column” (name),
escaped with double quotes, with last name and first name separated by a comma and space. Not ideal if Hogwarts wants to send a form letter 
to each student, as via mail merge, since it’d be strange to start a letter with:

Dear Potter, Harry,

Rather than with, for instance:

Dear Harry,

In a file called scourgify.py, implement a program that:

Expects the user to provide two command-line arguments:
the name of an existing CSV file to read as input, whose columns are assumed to be, in order, name and house, and
the name of a new CSV to write as output, whose columns should be, in order, first, last, and house.
Converts that input to that output, splitting each name into a first name and last name. Assume that each student will have both a first name and last name.
If the user does not provide exactly two command-line arguments, or if the first cannot be read, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
